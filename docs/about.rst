GeoNode's metadata model is based on the ISO 19115 standard. This standard defines the structure and content of metadata for geographic information and is widely used in the spatial data community. The standard includes information such as resource title, summary, keywords, spatial and temporal extent and contact information.

However, there is often a need to add custom metadata to layers or maps.

This app extends 
  - the metadata wizard with freely definable fields
  - the metadata detail view of a resource
  - the XML export of a dataset
